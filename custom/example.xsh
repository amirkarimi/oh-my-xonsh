# You can put `.xsh` files here and OMX will source them.
# Anything you add here will be ignored by git.
# Files on the `custom/` directory will be automatically
# loaded by the init script, in alphabetical order.

# For example: add an alias to projects you often work on.

# aliases['omxcustom'] = 'cd $OMX_CUSTOM_HOME'
